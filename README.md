# My Personal Project

- ## What will the application do?

My application is an **online game shop**. In my application, you can upload games that you made. You can choose its
price, category, difficulty, and description. Also, you can have a library, so you can see what game you upload there.
Moreover, you are provided convenient functions such as organizing your game in order of upload date or price. Although
you cannot actually upload real game and earn money in the application, but you can experience a convenient online game
shop which is focused on the people who just started to develop a game.

- ## Who will use it?

I believe that people who do not have much experience of making game but want to start making their own games and show
it to other people and make them buy it.

- ## Why is this project of interest to you?

Since when I was young I have been really interested in playing games. Since then, one of my goal was making my own 
game and sell it. However, when I looked at some online game application, most of the games there were so professional
and owned by a company. ***I wanted to make an application for the people who just start to develop their game and build
an experience.***

# Phase 4: Task 3
- ### If you had more time to work on the project, what refactoring might you use to improve your design? 
If I had more time to work on the project, I want to design my project more efficiently. When I started to design my
project, I did not learn how to write code. Because of that and there was not much time to work on it, I couldn't start 
my initial work efficiently and organize my code again. Looking at my project as a view learned coding a lot, in many
display classes, there are very many same format I used to design java swing. I believe I should've used abstract 
function to make the code more efficiently and reduce repetitive code. Also, when making buttons, if I had more time,
I want to study more about java swing and make my display better using buttons with different size and position because
my buttons all have same size and the method, setLayout, adjusts my buttons' position for saving time. Moreover, I want
to add more functions to my project such as organizing the games in library by different options and uploading an image
for each game in library for better visual effects.
